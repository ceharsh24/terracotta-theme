# Changelog

All notable changes to the Terracotta theme will be documented in this file.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **String escape characters now visually distinct** — escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`) use a shifted hue from their surrounding string color, making them identifiable without relying on bold
  - Light: `#764C00` → `#824020` (terracotta red-brown vs golden amber strings)
  - Light Bright: `#7C4F00` → `#844222`
  - Dark: `#F0C24E` → `#E8A050` (warm amber vs bright gold strings)
  - Dark Dimmed: `#DBAC3B` → `#E8A850` (orange-amber vs golden strings)
- **Operator/property color collision resolved in light themes** — operators shifted from near-identical deep blue to a muted blue-gray, creating clear separation from property accesses
  - Light: `#0053A7` → `#1A5878` (teal-blue operators) vs `#0550AE` (pure blue properties, unchanged)
  - Light Bright: `#0052A3` → `#1C5A7A` vs `#0349A4` (unchanged)
- **Built-in constants separated from numbers in light themes** — constants (`true`, `false`, `null`) shifted to burgundy, away from the plum used for numeric literals
  - Light: `#8B3045` → `#A32E42`
  - Light Bright: `#8A2C42` → `#A42C3E`
- **Dark theme built-in constants moved away from error red** — constants now use warm clay/peach instead of the salmon that was too close to error highlighting
  - Dark: `#E1948F` → `#D4A090`
  - Dark Dimmed TOML/YAML booleans aligned with general constant color `#E8A090`

### Fixed
- Dark Dimmed CSS property color `#65A9ED` (over-saturated) corrected to `#88AED0` to match the dimmed property palette
- Dark Dimmed TOML boolean, YAML null/boolean/merge colors corrected from tag color (`#D87A6A`) to constant color (`#E8A090`)
- All example files, playground, and documentation updated

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Dark theme constants shifted to amber** — constants now use `#CC8858` (Dark) and `#C08050` (Dark Dimmed), creating clear hue separation from keywords which remain orange
- **Light theme comments darkened** — improved WCAG headroom above the 4.5:1 floor
  - Light: `#78705E` → `#746C58` (4.9:1), doc comments `#706656` → `#6C6252` (5.6:1)
  - Light Bright: `#7C7466` → `#787060` (4.7:1), doc comments `#746A5C` → `#706658` (5.3:1)
- **Light Bright background warmed** — `#FDFCFA` → `#FAF9F4`, subtle parchment tone instead of near-white
- **Light Bright colors adjusted** for new background — operator `#0055A8` → `#0052A3`, punctuation `#737373` → `#6E6E6E`, SQL keyword `#AC1923` → `#A5151E`

### Fixed
- All 353 WCAG contrast pairs still pass (118 syntax + 235 UI)
- All example files, screenshots, and documentation updated

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Number colors upgraded to WCAG AAA** — all 4 non-HC variants now meet 7:1 contrast for numbers (previously some were below). Shifted from orange toward dusty rose for better hue separation from keywords
  - Dark: `#D89050` → `#D49288` (7.3:1)
  - Dark Dimmed: `#CC9D4D` → `#D49888` (7.2:1)
  - Light: `#A70B50` → `#80441E` (7.1:1)
  - Light Bright: `#AA0E53` → `#86461E` (7.2:1)
- **Variable color identity improved** — warmer golden-sand tones for better separation from comments and foreground text
  - Dark: `#BFB799` → `#C4B890`, Dark Dimmed: `#B5A78C` → `#C0AC88`, Light Bright: `#3D3530` → `#4A3828`
- **Comment colors** shifted to warm earth tones across all variants for cohesive palette identity
- Function colors refined across all variants for consistency
- Contrast checker regex fix: `\bnumber\b` → `\bnumbers?\b` to correctly classify numbers as Tier 1

### Fixed
- Light theme git added color adjusted (`#1A7A4C` → `#187548`) after sidebar background change
- Playground (`docs/index.html`) synced with all theme color changes
- All HTML examples and screenshots regenerated

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Full WCAG AAA compliance** — all 95 syntax color pairs across all 5 variants now meet the 7:1 AAA contrast threshold (previously some were AA-only at 4.5:1+)
- **UI contrast audit** — 235 workbench UI foreground/background pairs validated against WCAG AA (4.5:1); all active UI text now passes
- Contrast checker upgraded: threshold raised to AAA (7:1) for syntax, added UI pair validation with WCAG SC 1.4.3 exempt handling for inactive/decorative elements
- Light themes: button, badge, and status bar foregrounds switched from white to dark text on accent backgrounds for proper contrast
- Dark Dimmed: status bar error background lightened (`#BF6B66` → `#C06C67`) to clear AA threshold
- Key syntax color updates for AAA compliance:
  - **Dark**: keyword `#DA7756` → `#E98665`, numbers `#C88040` → `#D89050`, punctuation slightly lightened
  - **Dark Dimmed**: keyword `#D47A5C` → `#E88E70`, types `#AF85E6` → `#BC92F3`, numbers `#BF9040` → `#CC9D4D`, and 11 other minor lightening adjustments
  - **Light**: keywords, strings, regex, numbers, operators, functions, punctuation all darkened ~2–4 steps to clear 7:1
  - **Light Bright**: tag punctuation `#6B757F` → `#505A64`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **String vs Number separation** -- shifted number/constant colors in Dark (`#D0A050`) and Dark Dimmed (`#C49A4A`) to amber, creating clear visual distance from gold strings
- **Light theme variable visibility** -- shifted variable colors to warm brown (`#4A3F38` / `#3D3530`) in both light variants so variables no longer blend with foreground text
- Updated all 5 theme screenshots

### Added
- **Go language support** -- added builtin type scopes (`error`, `string`, `bool`, `byte`, `rune`, numeric types) colored as types, and `chan` keyword styled as italic operator across all 5 themes
- Complex showcase files for Python, React/TSX, and Go

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### Changed

- **Dark theme backgrounds** upgraded to Cursor-style pure neutral dark (`#141414`, `#1A1A1A`)

- **AAA-grade Comments** -- comment colors upgraded from WCAG AA to AAA (7.0:1+) in all variants
- **Perceptual distinctness** -- all core syntax tokens now separated by RGB distance Δ > 150, eliminating any chance of visual confusion between token types
